# IPC Actors

This repository includes the reference implementation of all the actors responsible for the operation of the IPC (InterPlanerary Consensus) protocol. These actors are written in Rust to be compiled in web assembly, and they target the FVM. This project is conformed by the following crates:
- `gateway`: Implementation of the IPC gateway.
- `subnet-actor`: Reference implementation of an IPC subnet actor.
- `atomic-exec`: Implementation of the atomic-execution coordinator actor along with all the basic primitives to run an atomic execution, and a sample fungible token contract implementing these primitives.
- `sdk`: SDK with convenient types and methods to interact with IPC.

## Building the actors
Building the actors in wasm is as simple as running `make build`. This command outputs the wasm bytecode for all of the actors in the `output/` directory.

### Bundling into the builtin-actors bundle
The FVM does not currently support the deployment of user-defined native actors, so in order to deploy thse native IPC actors, they need to be conveniently bundled into the builtin-actors bundle. To create a builtin-actors bundle including the IPC actors you can follow these steps: 
```bash
# Compile IPC actors
make build
# Clone our fork of builtin-actors including custom bundling code.
git https://github.com/adlrocha/builtin-actors
# Checkout the current branch compatible with ipc-actors
git checkout ipc-actors
# We need to point to the directory where the IPC actors have been compiled so they can be picked update
# by the builtin-actors bundling script
export IPC_ACTORS_PATH="<path_to>/ipc-actors/output"
# Build the bundle
BUILD_FIL_NETWORK="devnet" cargo build
```
The build command should return a similar output to the following, indicating all the actors that have been bundled and the path of the resulting `.car` file with the bundle.

Finally, to load the bundle into Lotus, the following env variable need to be set pointing to the car of our custom bundle:
```
export LOTUS_BUILTIN_ACTORS_V10_BUNDLE=<path_to_custom_car>
```
